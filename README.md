# Final proposal
## Question: How can agile philosophy benefit personal learning in a roleless creative game-development context?
By nature of iterative development, agile philosophy arguably promotes learning through adaptivity to change. This paper will explore how the agile philosophy may benefit personal development and learning in a game development context, with comparison to other workflows popular in the creative tech industries (including iterative). It will also attempt to address various resulting factors, such as development speed, quality of the final product, education through playtesting and the personal relationships promoted through the agile methodology.

# Proposals
## Research Proposal #1: How should agile teams manage cutting or replacing content in games
Owing to my interest in removed content in games, I would like to search and discover the effects of the agile philosophy on removed or replaced content--whether it results in more or less content being cut or replaced in games, compared to e.g. a waterfall approach. I aim to discover the positive and negative impacts of this: if it results in a more cut content, is the end result an improvement? If not, does more content get made, and is it of a good quality? How does it affect the time span of game development, and does its psychological impact on the developers keep work fresh and inspired compared to other approaches?

The interesting thing about the question is not strictly whether more content is lost, but whether or not it is a good thing. Agile works on an iterative philosophy, promoting fast creation of content in short, perhaps risky and innovative sprints; with the idea that risk is reduced over time as the final vision of the product is formed. Does it work? Is it in a good time span?

## Research proposal #2: Maximising and managing collaborative creativity in an agile workflow for game development
Agile development strongly promotes iteration, implying a bigger potential for experimentation. However, evidence suggests that further into the life cycle of a game, as its vision becomes more clearly defined and the deadline approaches, creativity goes to the back-burner, much as it does in more traditional waterfall workflows (though much sooner, during the planning phases). It calls into question how long the benefits of agile development last, and whether it attempts, perhaps haphazardly, to act as a mashup of the planning and development stages.  

Would a large-scale project would better benefit from a well-planned pre-production stage, followed by a fast rigid development phase--rather than the slow, iterative early development stage which will drive the ever-changing product throughout? Or with game development being an extremely risk-filled endeavor, and with it being well-established that games will change according to what is most preferred amongst players (as dictated by playtesting), is Agile development a slower but more effective solution?
## Research proposal #3: Role-setting and role-sharing in an agile development environment: free-for-all work and its pros and cons
One of the features of the agile workflow, particularly scrum task boards, is that developers will choose their own work, seemingly in a free-for-all manner. This essay addresses the challenges and solutions of managing roles in a roleless agile environment, wherein different developers of various skills and confidence must all decide who takes which tasks. How does this compare to a more traditional leader-oriented work flow?
## Research proposal #4: How agile philosophy can benefit personal learning in an educational environment, and comparison with other development methodologies
Does the iterative development promote personal learning in technical sense? How about communication?
## Research proposal #5: How to manage priorities, skills and communication in a roleless Agile-oriented team environment
A roleless game development environment--one where everyone has their strengths, with none fully recognised yet.
## Research proposal #6: To the Same Level - How to make creative decisions in a largely leaderless agile environment?
Agile philosophy has shown many strengths in general application programming through its "Customer collaboration" clause. Particularly, the contractor makes a request, and the team aim to satisfy it through a hypothetical user's perspective. However, game development is a creative and therefore very subjective endeavour. Agile philosophy makes no reference to 'fun and aesthetics over contractual obligation', yet making a fun and interesting game is usually high on a development team's priority list. Therefore, when a contractor wants a creative and fun product, it is the development team's job to make a vast swathe of subjective creative decisions to achieve it. This is no issue with a creative leader--but what about one without?  

This essay will explore the issue of creative subjectivity in a leaderless agile environment, how to settle on creative visions where the user story heavily depends on the user, and the positive effects of teambuilding and playtesting.
