# Final proposal
## Question: How can agile philosophy maximise personal learning in a roleless creative game-development context?
*As quoted by [Mr. Quote], iteration is a highly respected concept in the game industry, owing to the constant changing of approaches in pursuit of the highly dynamic and subjective goal of making a 'fun' game. [quote 'game never comes out the same']. This typically requires the adoption of a workflow that most suits iteration, such as the agile workflow, which places [derp] over [derpderp].  
*In universities today, such as Falmouth (which btw is pretty great), agile development has been adopted as a key part of the practical game production assignments. But being an educational institution comes with the interesting task of not only producing games, but learning how to do it, somehow simultaneously. This raised my particular interest: should agile be chosen for not only production purposes, but for individual learning as well?  
*To find an answer, this study chooses to look beyond the scope of university. As opposed to analysing the effects of agile evelopment in a specifically educational institute, this marginally noobish essay aims to draw links between existing practices and experiences in real-life studios, with how agile development (or more broadly, iteration) is applied, with the question of how they could maximise the learning experience for the individual team members.*  




By nature of iterative development, agile philosophy arguably promotes learning through adaptivity to change. This paper will explore how the agile philosophy may benefit personal development and learning in a game development context, with comparison to other workflows popular in the creative tech industries (including iterative). It will also attempt to address various resulting factors, such as development speed, quality of the final product, education through playtesting and the personal relationships promoted through the agile methodology.

# Notes
# Previous Proposals
## Research Proposal #1: How should agile teams manage cutting or replacing content in games
Owing to my interest in removed content in games, I would like to search and discover the effects of the agile philosophy on removed or replaced content--whether it results in more or less content being cut or replaced in games, compared to e.g. a waterfall approach. I aim to discover the positive and negative impacts of this: if it results in a more cut content, is the end result an improvement? If not, does more content get made, and is it of a good quality? How does it affect the time span of game development, and does its psychological impact on the developers keep work fresh and inspired compared to other approaches?

The interesting thing about the question is not strictly whether more content is lost, but whether or not it is a good thing. Agile works on an iterative philosophy, promoting fast creation of content in short, perhaps risky and innovative sprints; with the idea that risk is reduced over time as the final vision of the product is formed. Does it work? Is it in a good time span?

## Research proposal #2: Maximising and managing collaborative creativity in an agile workflow for game development
Agile development strongly promotes iteration, implying a bigger potential for experimentation. However, evidence suggests that further into the life cycle of a game, as its vision becomes more clearly defined and the deadline approaches, creativity goes to the back-burner, much as it does in more traditional waterfall workflows (though much sooner, during the planning phases). It calls into question how long the benefits of agile development last, and whether it attempts, perhaps haphazardly, to act as a mashup of the planning and development stages.  

Would a large-scale project would better benefit from a well-planned pre-production stage, followed by a fast rigid development phase--rather than the slow, iterative early development stage which will drive the ever-changing product throughout? Or with game development being an extremely risk-filled endeavor, and with it being well-established that games will change according to what is most preferred amongst players (as dictated by playtesting), is Agile development a slower but more effective solution?
## Research proposal #3: Role-setting and role-sharing in an agile development environment: free-for-all work and its pros and cons
One of the features of the agile workflow, particularly scrum task boards, is that developers will choose their own work, seemingly in a free-for-all manner. This essay addresses the challenges and solutions of managing roles in a roleless agile environment, wherein different developers of various skills and confidence must all decide who takes which tasks. How does this compare to a more traditional leader-oriented work flow?
## Research proposal #4: How agile philosophy can benefit personal learning in an educational environment, and comparison with other development methodologies
Does the iterative development promote personal learning in technical sense? How about communication?
## Research proposal #5: How to manage priorities, skills and communication in a roleless Agile-oriented team environment
A roleless game development environment--one where everyone has their strengths, with none fully recognised yet.
## Research proposal #6: To the Same Level - How to make creative decisions in a largely leaderless agile environment?
Agile philosophy has shown many strengths in general application programming through its "Customer collaboration" clause. Particularly, the contractor makes a request, and the team aim to satisfy it through a hypothetical user's perspective. However, game development is a creative and therefore very subjective endeavour. Agile philosophy makes no reference to 'fun and aesthetics over contractual obligation', yet making a fun and interesting game is usually high on a development team's priority list. Therefore, when a contractor wants a creative and fun product, it is the development team's job to make a vast swathe of subjective creative decisions to achieve it. This is no issue with a creative leader--but what about one without?  

This essay will explore the issue of creative subjectivity in a leaderless agile environment, how to settle on creative visions where the user story heavily depends on the user, and the positive effects of teambuilding and playtesting.

*The overall research objective of the study was to find out “What are the main product development trends among the game developers?”*  
*As a result, the game development work is often unpredictable and highly iterative, which makes the agile methodologies seem suitable models for adoption.*

Chosen for: Insight into iterative development--a fundamental factor in the agile philosophy  
*For    her,    the development  of  a  game  is  cyclic  in  its  nature  repeating  phases  of idea    generation,    conceptualization,    testing    and    evaluation. Iteration is necessary for the designer’s work in order to act as “an advocate for the player”, as Fullerton puts it.*  
*According  to Keith  [  11],  it  is  the  “practice  of  creating  an  initial  version  of something  (artwork,  code,  or  a  design),  examining  it,  and  then revising it until it’s sufficiently improved.” *  
*Larman and Basili [20] discuss the multitude of IID (iterative and incremental development) models. Modern usage of the term (IID) is  not  about  just  revisiting  work  (rework),  but  also  evolutionary advancement*  
*Furthermore,  the  perspective  of the designer  is  important  in  the study  of  iteration  in  design  work.  For  instance  Adams and  Atan [2 ]  concluded  in  their  study  of iterative  behavior  in  engineering student design processes that more skillful students conduct more iterations.*  
*Some  interviewees  expressed  how  they  have  been  experimenting with different approaches and eventually found the iterative model the most  efficient. The  iterative process  was  also connected to quality:”[...]  this  kind  of  constant  iteration  with a  playable  version  helps to make the game better.” Interviewee 1C2*  - Game developers on iteration

Chosen for: Generalistic detailed insight into collaboration in a team environment with particular socially-oriented examples, including voice recordings, demonstrating differences in roles, attitudes and creative conflict. Relevant to the question of agile development's applicability in creative development.
*The   team   develops   serious games on the Flash platform [9]* (<-- context)  
*The   social   environment   is   friendly and   team   members   are   committed  to  learning from  each  other.* <-- Very important! Because it very much agrees with my standpoint! Therefore important.  
*Each team member needs to be aware of what others are doing. Without situational awareness, it would be  very  difficult  to  work  effectively  since  the  work  of  one  member  often  depends  on  the  completion  of  some  other  work  by  another member* - This study was conducted in an environment where team situational awareness was maximises--Agile accomodates this with standups.  
*Teams  with  high  role  diversity  benefit  more  from  collaboration.  High role  diversity is  a  result  of  having  many  specialists.*  
*We  refer  to  this  as  working-in-pairs. Troubleshooting issues are easier to solve when working-in-pairs,  as  seen  in  this  exchange  between  the  GP  and  Lead Artist (LA): *  
*The  game  product  is  development  iteratively.  The  game  concept  starts  vague,  but  becomes  increasingly  complex  and  refined  after  each  iteration  cycle.  Through  iterative  refinement,  the  game  is  transformed  and  built  from  small  pieces  and  these  pieces  are  integrated  opportunistically  (537,  584,  2351). *  
*The  team  also  employs  two  tactics  to  support  rapid  iteration  and  evaluation  cycles.  One  tactic  is  to  give  priority  to  the  visible  result.  The  game  has-to-look-good.* - Note how this might have a negative effect on learning by shifting the focus to the game  
*They  have  an  understanding  that  the  product  should  be  fun,  educational  and  easy  to  play.  Being  in  agreement  about  the  higher  level  abstract  goals  allows  them  to  handle  disputes  and  move  forward  with  changes  more  easily.* - Note how this might have a positive effect on learning through a good attitude  
*effective  collaboration  requires  a  team  that  respects each other’s contributions, communicates frequently and shares  a  similar  conceptual  model  of  the  product  and  goals.* - Agile?

*For instance, when a technical problem popped up in Final Forecast, as long as four days could potentially pass before someone knowledgeable about the problem could meet with the team member in need.* - Pitfall of not meeting regularly  
*We  saw  this  with  Final  Forecast;  students  spent  entire meetings discussing interesting or fun ideas to add into the game.  Most were infeasible under the time constraints, but merely by expressing them, they would inspire new ideas in others.*  
*The ability to work cooperatively in a rapidly shifting team environment with people from different backgrounds and responsibilities on a successful project are highly desired skills for potential industry employers.*
