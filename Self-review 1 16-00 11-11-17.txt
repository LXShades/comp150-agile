Keep:
Reference to game industry in 'Why agile'
Group work issues -- this is a fundamental question in this topic

Change:
Dash between 'timeframe' and 'contrast' needs adjusting
The 'Why Agile' section might be a little long
Perhaps shorten the introduction so that questions are asked but not answered til the rest of the essay.
The comparison to waterfall could be shortened or moved to another paragraph addressing similar pitfalls?
'A comparison to industry' clashes with the benefits of active learning. Consider adding a 'improvement' section with direct and brief links to industry.'
'Identifying technical mistakes is a challenge to those who are unaware' - Cut for now, but this could squeeze into the issues of inexperienced members.
'Peer review' - this is too long, cut for now, but could go into the Agile section or be explained as a reason not to exclude inexperienced team members.

Add:
Look at personality differences? Find evidence of effects in industry

Mark estimates:
Articles are relevant: 3/5%
Focus: 2/2.5% - Much focus on question
Depth of agile insight: 7/15% - Not much focus on agile
Specificity, verifiability and accuracy: 1/2.5% - Decent backup, more reputable citations for free points!
Adequacy of Analysis: 8%/15% - Personal analysis was quite deep, but not thoroughly reiterated in article; but should it be?
Adequacy of transfer to the Game Industry: 6/10% - Some cited discussion on transfer to industry. Could cite more postmortems?
Spelling and Grammar: 2/2.5% - Confident
Appropriateness of Structure: 1.5/2.5% - Mildly confident

Total estimated marks: 56.4%. Didn't consider that 80% > professional competency in this review, so cut 80% from 70.5. Will consider next time. Can't remember the grade for this result.
