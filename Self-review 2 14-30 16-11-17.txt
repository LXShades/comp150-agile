Time to review this paper with a greater awareness of the rubric's actual expectations.

An overly complicated essay that delves too deep into things that the rubric doesn't ask for, though with a decent focus to answer the question it presented. Spelling and grammar is good although some sentences are too long. Subject matter is social and therefore highly debatable--however the rubric is not particularly interested in how correct my arguments are, so this is fine. Missing vital insight into the industry and agile. Analysis is alright; breadth of reading and synthesis of information is good: not what the rubric asks for. Rubric rubric rubric. A solid effort dropped into the wrong pile of bricks with a slight smell of rookie.

Appropriateness of references articles: 4/5 - quite a few well-known sources, although not entirely related to game development
Relevance to research question: 4/5 - this has to be something I did right.
Dpeth of Insight into the Agile philosophy: 2/5 - This is okay.
Adequacy of Analysis of Articles: 2/5 - To be honest, I was more interested in learning from the articles than criticising them.
Verifiability of claims: 3/5 - Some claims too bold
Adequacy of Discussion on Transfer to the Games Industry: 2/5 - There is some transfer.
Appropriateness of Academic Writing: 3/5 - Let's be optimistic and say I was a decent rookie. Reference section has been fixed and should be fully IEEE compliant.
Spelling and Grammar: 4/5 - Some long sentences
Essay structure: 2/5 - Some structure, but overall a little messy. Often paragraphs don't introduce any real conclusion or personal argument for the papers cited, and act only as side remarks and introductions.

How my greater awareness drives down my personal review score is sobering, but I feel I've learned from it. And proving that to myself has been more satisfying than citing papers about it.
